# 3-phase-Over-voltage-frequency-relay
A three-phase overvoltage and frequency monitoring system using Arduino that continuously measures voltage and frequency of all three phases. It compares real-time values with preset limits stored in EEPROM and triggers a relay to disconnect the load when limits are exceeded, ensuring protection of electrical equipment.
